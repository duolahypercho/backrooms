# THRESHOLD

A three-chapter first-person browser survival-horror game built with Three.js. Every campaign creates connected procedural Backrooms mazes with distinct environments, objectives, realistic lighting, spatial audio, environmental storytelling, collectible recordings, and a persistent animated hunter. Play solo or open a room for cooperative multiplayer with proximity voice.

## Chapters

- **Level 0, The Lobby:** learn the maze and find the EXIT.
- **Level 1, Maintenance:** replace three fuses to power the freight lift.
- **Level 2, Lower Tunnels:** open four drain valves and reach the hatch.

Each chapter has its own creature silhouette, motion, senses, sounds, hunt rhythm, and recovery window. The creature sees open sightlines, notices carried light, hears movement and loud interactions, searches your last known location, and can be escaped by breaking line of sight and disappearing into a genuinely dark area.

## Modular worlds and characters

Levels and multiplayer characters are auto-discovered content plugins. Add either `src/levels/<slug>/level.js` or `src/levels/<slug>.level.js` and it joins the campaign automatically; add the matching character form under `src/characters/` and it joins the deterministic avatar catalog. There is no central registry to edit. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [the level guide](src/levels/README.md), and [the character guide](src/characters/README.md).

Every run uses a shared seed to vary maze topology, prop clusters and colors, broken fixtures, objective/archive locations, rare abandoned scenes, collapsed non-graphic wanderers, chair piles, black motes, audio events, presentation glitches, and monster timing. Multiplayer fingerprints the complete level catalog, character IDs and versions, and shared-world algorithm revision; incompatible builds are rejected before a player can create or join a room.

## Survival loop

- The flashlight has a campaign-persistent battery. Turn it off to conserve charge; an empty light slowly recovers only a small emergency reserve.
- Darkness is useful. Under a failed fixture, switch the light off, stay quiet, and hold still until the HUD confirms **UNSEEN**. Moving, making noise, or being illuminated exposes you again.
- `Q` fires a short camera flash. It reveals the room but consumes 28–32% charge, makes a loud noise, and can make the creature look directly at you.
- Three optional archive recordings are hidden in every chapter. Playing one restores some flashlight charge and reveals a fragment of the facility's story.
- Fuses and valves must be held to completion. Repairs become louder as they progress, creating a risk-reward choice during a hunt.
- Fear now follows local danger rather than a timer. It rises through pursuit, darkness, isolation, and low charge, then recovers in reliable light or beside a teammate.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`, select **ENTER LEVEL 0**, and allow pointer lock. The development command starts both the game and its room server.

## Cooperative multiplayer

1. Select **HOST**, choose a callsign, and choose **PUBLIC** or **UNLISTED**.
2. Select **OPEN ROOM**, then use **SHARE INVITE** to send a direct join link (or share the five-character code).
3. Other players can select **ROOMS** and choose a public signal, or select **JOIN** and enter any room code directly.
4. In the four-player assembly room, choose a suit and select **READY UP**. When every connected survivor is ready, the host can select **START RUN**; each player then enters the level.

The room directory shows every public, occupied room on the connected multiplayer server, up to a denial-of-service-safe cap of 50 entries. It exposes only the room code, level, phase, connected player count, capacity, and joinability—never player names, IDs, positions, world seeds, objectives, monster state, or reconnect tokens. Unlisted rooms remain reachable to anyone who has their code; they are unlisted, not password-protected.

Rooms synchronize the campaign seed, maze layout, players, held objectives, shared archives, camera flashes, monster recovery, deaths, and level transitions. The active host owns the monster simulation and validates proximity, interaction duration, and flash cooldowns. Authority moves automatically if that player pauses, leaves, dies, or backgrounds the game.

### Voice chat

After joining a room, select **VOICE OFF** in the co-op HUD to grant microphone access and connect to opted-in teammates. **MIC LIVE** mutes or unmutes without leaving voice; selecting **VOICE ON** releases the microphone completely. Voice is spatially panned and gently attenuated using teammate positions for a more immersive in-level soundscape.

Audio travels peer-to-peer over WebRTC. The room server validates and relays only short-lived connection negotiation messages; it does not receive, record, or store the conversation. Voice never requests the microphone automatically, stops on room exit or page navigation, and pauses the local track while the tab is hidden.

For another device on the same network, everyone should open the `Network` address printed by `npm run dev`. Open that network address before copying an invite so the link contains a reachable host address. Local firewalls must allow ports `5173` and `8787`.

The default room service supports local and LAN play. Public internet play requires hosting the built site and WebSocket service behind a public `wss://` endpoint. Set `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_URL` at build time when the room service is not on port `8787` of the page host. All players browsing the same room list must connect to the same WebSocket service; separate self-hosted servers have separate directories.

The server accepts `MULTIPLAYER_HOST`, `MULTIPLAYER_PORT`, `MULTIPLAYER_PATH`, and `MULTIPLAYER_MAX_PLAYERS` environment variables. It defaults to `0.0.0.0`, port `8787`, path `/multiplayer`, and four players per room. The capacity can be lowered to two or three but is capped at four. Rooms are held in memory and disappear when the server restarts. For an internet deployment, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy, forward the configured WebSocket path, use `wss://`, apply connection limits, and do not treat room codes as authentication.

Local and LAN voice uses direct ICE candidates by default. For public internet voice, serve the game over HTTPS/WSS and set `VITE_VOICE_ICE_SERVERS` to a JSON array of STUN/TURN `RTCIceServer` entries. Some NATs require TURN rather than STUN alone. Do not embed permanent TURN secrets in a public client build; use temporary credentials or a credential service for production. WebRTC peers can receive network-address metadata during connection setup, and the four-player mesh can still be demanding on mobile devices.

## Controls

- `WASD` or arrow keys: move
- Mouse: look
- `Shift`: run
- `Ctrl` or `C`: crouch
- `F`: toggle flashlight
- `Q`: use a loud, battery-hungry camera flash
- Hold `E`: repair a fuse or valve
- `E`: play an archive, check a lock, or open the EXIT
- `Esc`: pause and release the mouse

Touch devices use a movement pad, right-side swipe look, run and crouch controls, flashlight and flash buttons, and a contextual hold/open button. Touch targets reflow for small phones, and sound/voice controls remain usable during play.

The game honors the operating system's **Reduce Motion** preference by disabling automatic blackout flicker and sharply reducing camera-flash intensity. The normal presentation contains flashing lights.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run validate:content
npm test
npm run preview
npm run server:multiplayer
```

The production output is written to `dist/`. Run the preview and multiplayer commands in separate terminals.
